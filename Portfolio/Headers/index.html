            <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
            <p>HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation.
                 These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet.
                  It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting;
                   and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.</p>

            <h1>What is the purpose of using HTML?</h1>
            <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is used to create web pages.
                 Site authors use HTML to format text as titles and headings, to arrange graphics on a webpage,
                  to link to different pages within a website, and to link to different websites.</p>

            <h1>What is the difference between HTML and CSS?</h1>
            <p>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup.
                 All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described,
                  often repeatedly, within the HTML.</p>

            <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
                language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
                 CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

            <h1>What is the use of CSS?</h1>
            <p>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media CSS saves a lot of work.
                 It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>

            <h1>Do you need to know HTML to use CSS?</h1>
            <p>Because CSS is used with HTML in various ways, a solid understanding of HTML is required before you can jump
                 straight into altering HTML elements using CSS. If youâ€™re just starting out with both CSS and HTML, you can even take
                  a learning path tailored to both. HTML is used to structure the website, and then CSS is layered over top for style.</p>
